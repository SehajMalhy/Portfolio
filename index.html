    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is my personal portfolio website. During this Information Technology course so far, I've learned about HTML, which is used
    for structuring webpages, and is responsible for adding text, images and other visible content within a webpage. I've also learned 
    about CSS, which is used for styling text and for layouts. It's responsible for things such as adding color to text,
    adding fonts etc.</p>

    <h1>My Work</h1>
    <p>This is the work that I've done so far in this course</p>
